A Julia set is a set of complex numbers that when iterated, do not approach infinity. Given a complex plane, each value on the plane can be interrogated to determine its presence in the set. There are infinte Julia sets that exist for infinte types of iterative equations. Perhaps the most well know are the Julia sets for z^2 + c. 

to add--
there are two functions to multiply complex numbers, I want to alter it so that it raises the power of the equation by a factor of 1 on mouse click.
